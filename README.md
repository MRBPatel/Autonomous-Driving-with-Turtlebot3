## Lab 1:
**Objective**: To map the real-world environment (Classroom) and create a virtual map.

**Tasks**:
1. Utilized Virtual Simulation in Rviz for the MAP-HOUSE.
2. Simulated a Classroom environment using Turtlebot3-burger in real-time.

## Lab 2:
**Objective**: To map a virtual environment with obstacles and walls using matplotlib.

**Tasks**:
1. Created a map for stage 1.
2. Mapped the autorace map.

## Lab 3:
**Objective**: Implementing a wall-following robot.

## Lab 4 (Final Project):
**Objective**: Developed a self-parking robot using the TurtleBot3 Burger kit programmed with ROS and Python.

**Description**:
- Created a wall follower with obstacle avoidance script that simultaneously collected LiDAR data and encoder values to generate a 2D point cloud map.
- Saved the parking spot coordinates using changes in LiDAR intensity values.
- Implemented an informed A* search algorithm to search for an optimal path to the parking spot.
- Utilized a PID controller to follow the path coordinates and park the robot on a provided spot marked with reflective tape.
